<h1>3rd Party Modules</h1>
<p>Modules are sets of actions that enhance the amount of things you can do with the bot maker.</p>
<p>As you'll be able to see in the action editor, each module has its own name (the blanked out categories)</p>
<p>Those are all in-built ones, however you can import modules that other people have made</p>
<h2>How to</h2>
<p>At the moment it's not easy, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to your user path (for windows it should be C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\discord-bot-maker</li>
    <li>Next, create a folder in there called "modules"</li>
    <li>Open it and copy and paste the wanted module into that folder</li>
    <li>The module may require extra installation steps but that's on the author to tell you how</li>
</ol>
<h2>Warnings</h2>
<p>No matter how much better these modules may make your experience, you must watch out as these modules are not verified, so people with malicious intent will be able to do anything they want with your computer.</p>
<p>Before installing one, check:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Do I trust this author?</li>
    <li>Did I get this from a safe place?</li>
    <li>Does it seem suspicous?</li>
    <li>(advanced) Have I checked over the modules code?</li>
</ol>
