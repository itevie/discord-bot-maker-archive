<h1>The Command Types</h1>
<p>There are a few ways to trigger a command, each have their own differences.</p>
<h2>The Prefix Type</h2>
<p>This one is only ran when the message content starts with your predefined prefix
    <br>
    e.g. if your prefix is <code>!</code> then <code>!help</code> would run it
</p>
<p>This is the only command type that has {{arg}} variables, learn more <button onclick="showFAQ('predefined_variables');">here</button></p>

<p>These do NOT have {{arg}} variables</p>
