<h1>If Statements</h1>
<p>If statements are a crucial thing to make your bot, they are able to check if a certain condition matches a criteria, if it doesn't you can have it run some other actions instead.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<code>
    If {{message:content}} is hello<br>
    &nbsp;reply-to-authors-message Hello!<br>
    If {{message:content}} is bye<br>
    &nbsp;reply-to-authors-message Bye!<br>
</code>
<p>Obviously, this won't work as it is not in action form.</p>
<p>But what happens here is, it first checks if the message content is "hello",
    <br>&nbsp;If it is: it'll respond with "hello!" and continue to the next action
    <br>&nbsp;If it isn't: it'll skip the action after the if (reply-to-authors-message Hello!) and continue after that
</p>
<p>After this it'll do the same with the second if.</p>
<h2>One action if's</h2>
<p>At the moment, full ifs do not exist so one action ifs exist, these check a condition and only execute or skip the action after this
    <br>(you can see this visually as there is an indent in the action creator.)
</p>
<h2>The types</h2>
