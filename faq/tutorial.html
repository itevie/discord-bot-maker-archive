    <br>Head over to the Bots tab and you should now see a list containing your new bot.
    <br>You will also see some buttons next to it, click "Start" and your bot will start.

<h2>Step 3 - Testing it</h2>
<p>If you have a look in the Commands tab, you will notice that there is a command already there!
    <br>As it says in the comment, in the server you invited your bot to, run !example and it should send you a message (how magical!)
