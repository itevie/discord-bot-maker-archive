<h1>Creating a command</h1>
<p>Commands are a fundamental thing for your bot's functionality.</p>
<p>To get started, let's understand all the different parts of the bot creator.</p>
<h2>Command Name</h2>
<p>The command name is the identifer for every command, for example, if your command type is prefix then this will be the command that you will run
    <br>For example if your command name is "help" and your prefix is "!" then you would run it by typing "!help"
</p>
<p>
    <i>Note: a command name must be unique, 2 commands cannot share the same name</i>
</p>
